# Michael Newham's Resume Project

This resume website serves four seperate pages - all linked by a central navbar. These pages are index, resume, projects and contact. A seperate link on the navbar provides access to a downloadable PDF version of the printed resume. Both the 'header' and 'footer' segments remain the same throughout, while the 'section' segment changes with each page.

I chose example idea 3 - 'Build a Personal Portfolio Site' as the project for my first milestone.  The original Code Institute 'Mini Project with Bootstap 4' template was used for this. Extensive changes were made for my own version - with an extra page, update codebases, styling and iconography.
 
## UX
### Who is the website for?
#### User-Type > Recruiters
My Resume / Personal Portfolio site is aimed at recruiters who are looking at employing or contracting a person with the appropiate skill-set.

#### User-Type > Mid-Level Managers
The site is also geared toward the needs of managers in mid-sized companies / multi-nationals who wish to recruit directly from the market.

### What is it that they want to achieve?
Both recruiters & managers want to assess quickly the work & skills background of any potential candidate they would like to call for interview. They want to see a clear layout, understandable navigation and a link to download a much more comprehenive witten CV / Resume.

### How my 'project' helps recruiters.
THere is only four pages on my Resume site, each based on a CSS Grid patteern of 2 boxes for the top segment, 4 boxes for the navbar, 2 boxes for the detailed section in the middle and a final box for the footer at the end.

All information pertaining to contact details, about me, work / skill history, details concerning projects all all formatted according to the 'bootstrap' CSS styles which they all employ.

All this serves to ensure that both recruiters & managers can make a quick decision as to what engagement (if any) they may wish to undertake.

### Wireframes
I used **[www.Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)** to create multiple wireframes for the devices listed below. 'Wireframe' was easy to use and avoided the complicated install that 'balsamiq' would have required on my linux laptop.

#### - iPhone
iPhone size was 375px * 667px.
Link to an example iPhone wireframe for the **[contact page is here.](https://github.com/MichaelNewham/CI-Milestone-1_Michael_Newham_Resume/blob/master/wireframes/4-Wireframe_iPhone_Contact-html-Mid_Section-.png)** 

### - iPad
iPad / Tablet size was 1024px * 768px.
Link to an example iPad wireframe for the **[projects page is here](https://github.com/MichaelNewham/CI-Milestone-1_Michael_Newham_Resume/blob/master/wireframes/3-Wireframe_iPad_Projects-html.png)**.

### - Laptop
Average laptop size used was 1440*900.

### Features Left to Implement
- I would like to increase the contrast of the pages so that they are more 'readable' by those with impaired vision.
- Inlude a PHP server (or other appropiate technology) to allow the emil submit button to function properly.

## Technologies Used
- Installed Emmet Snippet & Auto-completion. Used to auto include 'Emmet' html boilerplate code on any line.

- Used latest Bootstrap CDN library "5.0.0-beta2" from here > https://bit.ly/3amtYbB for all pages.

- Used latest FontAwesome library "5.12.2" from here > https://bit.ly/3uuDmmU to allow icon insertion on all pages.

- Used 'Google Font' at top of style.css file to allow inclusion of various fonts from here > fonts.google.com.

## Testing

Code on all pages was tested using the following validation tools >

- **Checked CSS** (all pages) with https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/  No personal code errors / warnings.

- **Checked HTML** (all pages) with https://validator.w3.org/. No personal code errors / warnings.

- Checked HTML / CSS (all pages) with **Google Chrome Lighthouse** (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).  Achieved 79% Score.

- Checked HTML from index.html page with **WebAim Accessibity Tool** (https://wave.webaim.org/).  No errors were returned.

- Screenshots of all test results can be found in the folder 'validation_screengraps' here > https://bit.ly/3km8LDn

## Deployment

I used **GitHub Pages** (https://pages.github.com/) to quickly deploy my project. The lated deployment link for my 'Resume' site is at the top of this list > (https://bit.ly/2Nu88vD).
